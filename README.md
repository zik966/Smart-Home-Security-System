**Smart Home Security System**
This project implements a basic smart home security system using an ESP32 development board, sensors, and actuators. The system detects intrusions and alerts the user through a buzzer and a notification sent to a server.
**Hardware:**
* ESP32 Development Board
* PIR Motion Sensor
* Buzzer
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard (optional)
**Software:**
* Arduino IDE
* WiFi, HTTPClient, and ArduinoJson libraries
**Installation:**
1. **Install Arduino IDE:** Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
2. **Install libraries:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries...".
   - Search for and install the following libraries:
     - WiFi
     - HTTPClient
     - ArduinoJson
3. **Modify code:**
   - Open the provided code in the Arduino IDE.
   - Replace placeholders with your actual Wi-Fi SSID, password, and server address.
   - Adjust pin numbers for PIR sensor and buzzer if necessary.
**Wiring:**
* Connect the PIR sensor's output to the ESP32's digital pin (defined in the code).
* Connect the buzzer to the ESP32's digital pin (defined in the code).
* Connect the ESP32 to a power source (e.g., USB or external power supply).
**Server Setup:**
1. **Create a server:** Set up a server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or a web service) to receive and process the alert messages sent by the ESP32.
2. **Handle incoming requests:** Implement code on the server to receive HTTP POST requests from the ESP32 and handle the received data (e.g., log the alert, send notifications).
**Running the System:**
1. Upload the code to the ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Power on the ESP32.
3. The system will start monitoring for motion.
4. If motion is detected, the buzzer will sound, and an alert will be sent to the server.
**Enhancements:**
* **Add more sensors:** Integrate other sensors like door/window sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, etc.
* **Implement remote control:** Allow users to control the system remotely through a mobile app or web interface.
* **Cloud integration:** Store sensor data and alerts in the cloud for long-term storage and analysis.
* **Improve security:** Implement security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access.
* **Add machine learning:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to improve intrusion detection and reduce false alarms.
